Basic Courier Service Rails App


## Getting Started
This is all the work I did in a day, please provide your feedback, it will be resourceful to me.

1. Install required Gems

        $ cd path_to_courier_service && bundle install

2. create database.yml and .env

        $ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

        $ cp .env.example .env

3. Create and migrate database.

## NOTE: If the click isn't working in any page, please just refresh it, it will work. There's some bug because of that its not working sometimes, will fix the bug working on something else in priority
